### **Product Requirements Document: Project Task Management Software**

#### **1. Introduction**

**1.1. Background**

In today's competitive business environment, effective project management is crucial for organizational success. Many teams struggle with managing multiple projects simultaneously, leading to a lack of visibility into project progress, inefficient resource allocation, and a higher risk of project delays and failures. This document outlines the requirements for a new Project Task Management Software designed to provide a centralized platform for planning, executing, and monitoring projects, thereby enhancing team collaboration and improving project outcomes. The primary driver for this product is the need for clear visibility into key project indicators and proactive risk management through automated alerts.

**1.2. Target Users**

*   **Project Leaders/Managers:** Responsible for planning projects, assigning tasks, monitoring progress, and reporting to stakeholders. They need a high-level overview of all projects and the ability to drill down into specifics.
*   **Team Members:** Responsible for executing assigned tasks, updating their progress, and collaborating with other team members. They need a clear view of their responsibilities and deadlines.
*   **Stakeholders/Executives:** Individuals who need to understand the overall status of projects and key metrics but are not involved in the day-to-day execution.

**1.3. Product Vision**

To create an intuitive and powerful project task management software that empowers teams to deliver projects on time and within budget. We aim to achieve this by providing a comprehensive set of tools for project planning, task management, progress visualization, and intelligent, automated early warnings to proactively address potential issues. Our vision is to transform project management from a reactive to a proactive discipline.

#### **2. User Stories and Scenario Descriptions**

**2.1. Project Leader**

*   **As a Project Leader, I want to create a new project and define all its key attributes so that I can establish a clear foundation for project planning.**
    *   *Scenario:* Sarah, a project manager, needs to set up a new "Q4 Marketing Campaign" project. She navigates to the "Create Project" screen and fills in the project name, assigns it to the "Marketing" department, sets the initial status to "Planning," designates herself as the person in charge, and adds her team members. She then inputs the planned start and end dates, notes its dependency on the "Website Redesign" project, and outlines the key milestones.

*   **As a Project Leader, I want to break down a project into specific tasks and assign them to team members so that everyone knows their responsibilities.**
    *   *Scenario:* After creating the project, Sarah breaks it down into tasks like "Develop Ad Creatives," "Write Blog Posts," and "Launch Social Media Campaign." She assigns each task to the relevant team member and sets individual deadlines.

*   **As a Project Leader, I want to view a visual representation of the project's progress so that I can quickly assess its health and identify potential bottlenecks.**
    *   *Scenario:* A week into the project, Sarah looks at the project dashboard. She sees a Gantt chart showing the project timeline and task dependencies. She also reviews a burndown chart that visualizes the remaining work against the planned timeline, allowing her to quickly gauge if the project is on track.

*   **As a Project Leader, I want to receive automated early warnings for potential project delays so that I can take corrective action in a timely manner.**
    *   *Scenario:* The system detects that a critical task is behind schedule and is likely to impact a key milestone. It automatically sends an email and an in-app notification to Sarah, warning her of the potential delay and its impact on the project's end date.

**2.2. Team Member**

*   **As a Team Member, I want to see all the tasks assigned to me in a clear and organized manner so that I can prioritize my work effectively.**
    *   *Scenario:* John, a marketing specialist, logs into the system. His personal dashboard displays a list of his assigned tasks, sorted by due date, for all the projects he is a part of.

*   **As a Team Member, I want to update the status and progress of my tasks easily so that my project leader and team are aware of my work.**
    *   *Scenario:* John has just completed the first draft of the ad creatives. He updates the task status from "In Progress" to "In Review" and marks the progress as 75% complete.

#### **3. Product Scope & Features**

**3.1. Project Management**

*   **Project Creation and Editing:** Ability to create new projects with the following fields: project name, department, status (e.g., Not Started, Planning, In Progress, On Hold, Completed), person in charge, members, planned start time, planned end time, dependencies, actual completion time, time consumed, completion rate (%), milestones, and remarks.
*   **Project Dashboard:** A centralized view for each project displaying key information, including a summary of the project indicators, a progress table, and visualizations.

*   **Status Updates:** Members can update the status of their tasks (e.g., To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done).
*   **Progress Tracking:** Members can update the percentage of completion for their tasks.

**3.3. Progress Visualization**

*   **Gantt Charts:** To visualize project timelines, task dependencies, and overall project schedule.
*   **Kanban Boards:** To visualize the workflow of tasks through different stages (To Do, In Progress, Done).
*   **Burndown/Burnup Charts:** To track the completion of work over time against the plan.
*   **Project Health Dashboard:** A visual summary of project completion rate, time consumed, and milestone tracking.

**3.4. Automated Early Warnings**

*   **Rule-Based Alerts:** The system will automatically send notifications (in-app and email) to the person in charge and relevant members based on predefined rules.
*   **Alert Triggers:**
    *   A task is approaching its due date and is not yet started.
    *   A task is overdue.
    *   A project's completion rate is significantly behind the planned timeline.
    *   A dependent task is being delayed, impacting subsequent tasks.

#### **4. Product-specific AI requirements**

**4.1. Model requirements (functions, performance indicators)**

*   **Functions:**
    *   **Predictive Delay Warning:** An AI model that predicts the probability of a task or project being delayed based on historical data and current progress. It will go beyond simple rule-based alerts to identify complex patterns that may lead to delays.
    *   **Task Prioritization Suggestions:** For team members with multiple tasks across projects, the AI can suggest a prioritized task list based on urgency, dependencies, and project impact.
*   **Performance Indicators:**
    *   **Prediction Accuracy:** The delay prediction model should achieve a precision of over 85% to ensure users trust the warnings.
    *   **Latency:** AI-driven suggestions and warnings should be generated in near real-time (under 500ms).

**4.2. Data requirements (source, quantity, quality, annotation)**

*   **Source:** The primary data source will be the project and task data generated within the application itself. This includes planned vs. actual start/end times, task dependencies, status updates, and member assignments from past projects.
*   **Quantity:** The models will require a substantial amount of historical data from at least 1,000 completed projects to be trained effectively.
*   **Quality & Annotation:** Data quality is crucial. We will need to ensure consistent data entry. For the initial training, completed projects will need to be annotated with labels such as "Delayed" or "On-Time."

**4.3. Algorithm boundaries and interpretability**

*   **Boundaries:** The predictive models will be most effective for projects that follow a somewhat standard lifecycle. They may not perform as well for highly unique or unprecedented projects with no historical parallels. The system's predictions are suggestions, and the final decision-making authority rests with the project leader.
*   **Interpretability:** The AI should provide a brief explanation for its warnings. For instance, if it predicts a delay, it should state the key contributing factors (e.g., "based on the delay of 3 out of 5 preceding tasks and the current assignee's historical performance on similar tasks").

**4.4. Evaluation criteria**

*   The success of the AI features will be evaluated based on:
    *   A/B testing to compare project completion rates for teams using AI-powered warnings versus those with only rule-based alerts.
    *   User feedback and satisfaction surveys on the usefulness and accuracy of the AI suggestions.

**4.5. Ethics and compliance**

*   **Data Privacy:** All user and project data will be anonymized before being used for model training to protect privacy.
*   **Bias:** The models will be regularly audited to ensure they do not exhibit bias, for example, by unfairly flagging certain team members as more likely to cause delays.

#### **5. Non-functional requirements**

*   **Performance:**
    *   The system should load pages within 2 seconds.
    *   It should support at least 100 concurrent users without a degradation in performance.
*   **Security:**
    *   All user data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.
    *   The system should have role-based access control to ensure users can only see and edit information relevant to their permissions.
*   **Usability:**
    *   The user interface should be intuitive and require minimal training for new users.
    *   The system should be accessible on major web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Reliability:** The system should have an uptime of 99.8%.
